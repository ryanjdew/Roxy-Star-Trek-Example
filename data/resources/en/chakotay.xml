	<sem:object>Chakotay is a fictional character who appeared in each of the seven seasons of the American science fiction television series Star Trek: Voyager. Portrayed by Robert Beltran, he is First Officer aboard the Starfleet starship USS Voyager. The character is a Native American, the first time that a main character in the Star Trek franchise has come from that culture. This was an intended move by the producers of the series, who sought to provide an inspiration as with Uhura in Star Trek: The Original Series for African Americans.
Reviewers were critical of the stereotypical nature of Chakotay's Native American heritage. This led to comparisons with Tonto, and that the inclusion of "Hollywood" versions of vision quests and meditation techniques were contrary to the character's in-universe tribal background. However, he was praised as a role-model for Native American science fiction and called "ground-breaking".</sem:object>
